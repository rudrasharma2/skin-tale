**Wrinkles**
Assesses fine lines and signs of aging. Higher scores indicate smoother skin with fewer visible wrinkles.

**Sagging**
Evaluates skin firmness and elasticity. Higher scores indicate firmer, more elastic skin.

**Hydration**

## Troubleshooting & FAQs

### Camera and Permissions

**Q: The app says it needs camera permission. Why?**
A: SkinTale needs camera access to capture photos of your face for skin analysis. Without camera permission, the app cannot perform its core function.

**Q: I denied camera permission. How do I enable it?**
A: Go to Settings > Privacy & Security > Camera > SkinTale, and toggle the permission on. Then restart the app.

**Q: Why does the app need photo library access?**
A: Photo library access allows you to save your scan results and access previously saved analyses.

### Analysis Issues

**Q: The analysis is taking too long or failing.**
A: This may be due to:
- Poor internet connection (required for AI analysis)
- Server issues with OpenAI
- Very large image file size

Try these steps:
1. Check your internet connection
2. Ensure you have a stable WiFi or cellular connection
3. Restart the app and try again
4. If the issue persists, contact support

**Q: The results don't seem accurate.**
A: Analysis accuracy depends on:
- Photo quality and lighting
- Camera angle and distance
- Makeup or filters on the face
- Image clarity

For best results, follow the "Tips for Best Results" section above.

### How the AI Works

**Q: How does SkinTale analyze my skin?**
A: SkinTale uses OpenAI's advanced GPT-4 Vision AI technology to analyze facial images. The AI has been trained to identify various skin conditions and characteristics based on visual analysis.

**Q: Is the analysis as accurate as a dermatologist?**
A: No. SkinTale provides informational insights about your skin but is not a substitute for professional medical advice. Always consult a dermatologist for medical concerns.

**Q: Can I trust the AI recommendations?**
A: The AI provides general skincare guidance based on detected skin characteristics. However, everyone's skin is unique. Consider the recommendations as a starting point and adjust based on what works for you.

### Privacy and Data

**Q: Where are my photos stored?**
A: Your scan history and photos are stored locally on your device only. We do not store your images on any external servers.

**Q: Are my photos sent anywhere?**
A: Yes, during analysis, your photo is sent to OpenAI's secure API for processing. The image is processed in real-time and is not permanently stored by OpenAI beyond what's necessary for processing. See OpenAI's privacy policy for details: https://openai.com/policies/privacy-policy

**Q: What data does SkinTale collect?**
A: SkinTale only collects the minimum data necessary to function:
- Photos you take for analysis (stored locally)

We do not collect personal information, contact lists, location data, or other device data.

2. Restart your device
3. Check for app updates in the App Store
